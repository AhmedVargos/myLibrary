# My Library
With this application helps users with keeping track of their books, each user will have the ability to create shelfs, and add PDF books to the shelfs, Can read books using PDF.js open source library from Mozilla, and take notes by selecting any text in the books, and viewing all his notes in the notes section and go to the page by clicking the note was written before.

## Installation

No installation is required.

## Usage

To use this app you need to run an pplication server to host it, since the PDF.js library requires running from a service;
it won't work using the File system (opening the files directly on the browser).
We recommend to install http-server node package using $npm install -g http-server then running $http-server in the main application directory .

After adding a book to a shelf, the books itself must be moved manually to Books folder inside main project directory ( “/Books” ).
